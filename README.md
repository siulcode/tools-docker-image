# Terraform and AWS CLI Docker image

## 📦 Supported tags and respective Dockerfile links

Available image tags can be found on the Docker Hub registry: [zenika/terraform-aws-cli](https://hub.docker.com/r/zenika/terraform-aws-cli/tags)

Supported versions are listed in the [`supported_versions.json`](https://github.com/Zenika/terraform-aws-cli/blob/master/supported_versions.json) file.

The following image tag strategy is applied:

* `zenika/terraform-aws-cli:latest` - build from master
  * Included CLI versions are the latest in [`supported_versions.json`](https://github.com/Zenika/terraform-aws-cli/blob/master/supported_versions.json) file.
* `zenika/terraform-aws-cli:release-S.T_terraform-UU.VV.WW_awscli-XX.YY.ZZ` - build from releases
  * `release-S.T` is the release tag
  * `terraform-UU.VV.WWW` is the **Terraform** version included in the image
  * `awscli-XX.YY.ZZ` is the **AWS CLI** version included in the image

Please report to the [releases page](https://github.com/Zenika/terraform-aws-cli/releases) for the changelogs.

> Any other tags are not supported even if available.

## 💡 Motivation

The goal is to create a **minimalist** and **lightweight** image with these tools in order to reduce network and storage impact.

This image gives you the flexibility to be used for development or as a base image as you see fits.

## 🔧 What's inside ?

Tools included:

* [Terraform CLI](https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/index.html)
* [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/fr/cli/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for Terraform remote module usage
* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to process JSON returned by AWS
* [OpenSSH Client](https://www.openssh.com/) to handle Terraform module clone over SSH
* This image uses a non-root user with a UID and GID of 1001 to conform with docker security best practices.

## 🚀 Usage

### 🐚 Launch the CLI

Set your AWS credentials (optional) and use the CLI as you would on any other platform, for instance using the latest image:

```bash
echo AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
echo AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
echo AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=YOUR_DEFAULT_REGION

docker container run -it --rm -e "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}" -e "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}" -e "AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=${AWS_DEFAULT_REGION}" -v ${PWD}:/workspace zenika/terraform-aws-cli:latest
```

> The `--rm` flag will completely destroy the container and its data on exit.

### ⚙️ Build the image

The image can be built locally directly from the Dockerfiles, using the build script.

It will :

* Lint the Dockerfile with [Hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint);
* Build and tag the image `zenika/terraform-aws-cli:dev`;
* Execute [container structure tests](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-structure-test) on the image.

```bash
# launch build script
./dev.sh
```

Optionally, it is possible to choose the tools desired versions :

```bash
# Set tools desired versions
AWS_CLI_VERSION=2.12.6
TERRAFORM_VERSION=1.5.2

# launch the build script with parameters
./dev.sh $AWS_CLI_VERSION $TERRAFORM_VERSION
```
